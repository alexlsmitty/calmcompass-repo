    {
      "id": "faq-001",
      "question": "What can I expect in my first therapy session?",
      "answer": "Your first session is primarily an intake appointment where your therapist will get to know you and your concerns. You'll discuss what brings you to therapy, your background, and your goals. Your therapist will explain their approach and how they might work with your specific situation. It's also an opportunity for you to ask questions and determine if the therapist is a good fit for your needs."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-002",
      "question": "How long does therapy typically last?",
      "answer": "The length of therapy varies widely depending on your specific goals, the nature of your concerns, and the type of therapy. Some focused interventions might last 8-12 sessions, while more complex issues might benefit from longer-term work. Many clients attend weekly sessions for a few months, then taper to less frequent visits as they progress. Your therapist will discuss recommendations for your situation and adjust the plan as needed."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-003",
      "question": "Is therapy confidential?",
      "answer": "Yes, therapy is confidential with a few specific exceptions required by law. These exceptions include situations involving immediate danger to yourself or others, suspected abuse of children or vulnerable adults, and certain legal proceedings. Your therapist will explain confidentiality and its limits during your first session."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-004",
      "question": "How do I know if I need therapy?",
      "answer": "You might consider therapy if you're experiencing persistent distress, feeling overwhelmed, noticing significant changes in mood or behavior, having difficulty with relationships, or struggling to cope with life transitions. Therapy can be beneficial not only for addressing specific mental health concerns but also for personal growth, improved relationships, and enhanced wellbeing."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-005",
      "question": "Do you accept insurance?",
      "answer": "Yes, we accept several major insurance plans, including Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare, and more. We recommend contacting your insurance provider to verify your specific coverage for mental health services. Our administrative team is also available to help answer insurance questions."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-006",
      "question": "What's the difference between a psychiatrist, psychologist, and therapist?",
      "answer": "Psychiatrists are medical doctors who can prescribe medication and sometimes provide therapy. Psychologists typically have doctoral degrees (PhD, PsyD) and provide therapy and psychological testing but cannot prescribe medication in most states. Therapists may include licensed counselors, social workers, and marriage and family therapists, all of whom provide various forms of talk therapy but cannot prescribe medication. All these professionals work together in the mental health field, often referring to each other as needed."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-007",
      "question": "Do you offer virtual therapy sessions?",
      "answer": "Yes, we offer secure, HIPAA-compliant video sessions for most of our services. Virtual therapy (also called telehealth) makes therapy accessible regardless of location, transportation limitations, or other barriers to in-person care. We use a secure platform designed specifically for healthcare, and your therapist will help you get set up prior to your first virtual appointment."
